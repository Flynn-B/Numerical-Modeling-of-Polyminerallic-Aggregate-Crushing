# Utilizing Dream3D to Export Data for DEM Simulation

DREAM3D-NX by BlueQuartz Software is a high level integrated environment to process, quantify, and represent microstructures. It is a stochastic based model with other general purpose applications. 

In this project, Dream3D will be used to segment voxel based models into STL files that will later be meshed with Gmsh into ASCII VTK files readable by LIGGGHTS for DEM analysis. 

The Dream3D pipelines included in this file allow exporting all clumps/clusters by mineral type. 

## Installation

Installation instructions are provided on the [Dream3D website](https://www.dream3d.io/Download/).

A license is needed, but students at academic institutions are provided a free yearly license. More found [here](https://www.dream3d.io/License/)
